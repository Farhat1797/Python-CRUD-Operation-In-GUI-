# Python CRUD operation in Gui
The Python GUI CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) Operations Project is a desktop application designed to perform basic database operations on a set of data using a graphical user interface (GUI). This project is a fundamental introduction to GUI programming in Python, providing users with an intuitive interface to manage and manipulate data seamlessly.

Technologies Used:
Tkinter:

Tkinter is the primary GUI toolkit used for building the graphical user interface.
SQLite (Optional):

SQLite can be used as a lightweight and embedded database for this project. Alternatively, other databases like MySQL or PostgreSQL can be integrated based on project requirements.
Python:

Python serves as the core programming language for developing the application logic and handling data.

# Key Features:

## Create Operation:

Users can add new records to the database by filling out a form in the GUI. The form may include fields corresponding to different attributes of the data.
## Read Operation:

Display the existing records from the database in a user-friendly manner. Use tables or lists to present the data, allowing users to easily view the information.
## Update Operation:

Enable users to edit and update existing records. Provide an edit functionality that allows modifications to specific fields of a record.
## Delete Operation:

Allow users to remove records from the database. Implement a delete function that prompts users to confirm their intention before removing a record.

## Search and Filter:

Provide a search feature to find specific records based on user-defined criteria. Additionally, implement filters to narrow down the displayed data based on certain conditions.
